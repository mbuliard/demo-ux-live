## DEMO FOR LIVE URL

Only a small demo to show that when using https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/2673 
the LiveProps can be set in clean url when they match route parameters.

## How to use
Git clone, install as usual, link the branch of the PR, and run the server.

Just go to the `/` page and play with the inputs to see url being updated.
